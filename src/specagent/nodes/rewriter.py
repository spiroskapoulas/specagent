Original question: {question}

The retrieval system found these documents, but they may not be relevant:
{retrieved_chunks_summary}

Rewrite the question to be more specific and likely to match 3GPP specification language.
Consider:
- Expanding acronyms (e.g., "UE" → "User Equipment (UE)")
- Adding technical context (e.g., "handover" → "RRC connection handover procedure")
- Specifying the protocol layer or interface
- Using terminology from 3GPP TS documents

Examples:
Original: "What is handover?"
Rewrite: "RRC connection reconfiguration procedure for X2 handover in 5G NR"

Original: "DRX cycle?"
Rewrite: "Discontinuous Reception (DRX) cycle configuration parameters in TS 38.331"

Original: "HARQ process?"
Rewrite: "Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) process configuration and timing in NR physical layer TS 38.214"

Provide only the rewritten question, nothing else."""
